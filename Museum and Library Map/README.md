This app serves as a dynamic Google Map API that allows users to search for Canadian locations and places to see nearby museums and libraries. All libraries and museums are displayed on the map with clickable markers that hold their name and city/town.

When the user starts a query, their entry is live-checked for relevant results which will be suggested to them. User input and API data is validated to make sure a location and the museums/libraries are properly displayed.

Choosing a location from the Google Maps API query will zoom and center on this location. The map also allows the user to freely move around, zoom in/out, and go to Street View.
