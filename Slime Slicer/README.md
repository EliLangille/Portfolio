README

Please ensure that the pygame module is installed in order for this game to run.

I (Eli Langille) am the sole creator of this game, though the visual and audio assets were downloaded from various users on itch.io according to their terms of use. All parts of this game are free to use including my code, though please give credit.

The scorekeeper.txt file includes my all-time high score, so have fun trying to beat it! The file will automatically update with your new scores and the dates they were recorded.

Note: Working on including names in high scores for the future.
